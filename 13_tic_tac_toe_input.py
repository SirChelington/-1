Tic tac toe input
Here's the backstory for this challenge: imagine you're writing a tic-tac-toe game,
where the board looks like this:

1:  X | O | X
   -----------
2:    |   |  
   -----------
3:  O |   |

    A   B  C
The board is represented as a 2D list:

board = [
    ["X", "O", "X"],
    [" ", " ", " "],
    ["O", " ", " "],
]
Imagine if your user enters "C1" and you need to see if there's an X or O in that cell on the board.
To do so, you need to translate from the string "C1" to row 0 and column 2 so that you can check board[row][column].

Your task is to write a function that can translate from strings of length 2 to a tuple (row, column).
Name your function get_row_col; it should take a single parameter 
which is a string of length 2 consisting of an uppercase letter and a digit.

For example, calling get_row_col("A3") should return the tuple (2, 0) because A3 corresponds to the row at index 2
and column at index 0in the board.

### my solution


def get_row_col(string_of_two):
    dictionary = {
        "A1": (0, 0),
        "A2": (1, 0),
        "A3": (2, 0),
        "B1": (0, 1),
        "B2": (1, 1),
        "B3": (2, 1),
        "C1": (0, 2),
        "C2": (1, 2),
        "C3": (2, 2),
    }
    return dictionary[string_of_two]


print(get_row_col("A3"))


### example solution

"""
def get_row_col(choice):
    translate = {"A": 0, "B": 1, "C": 2}
    letter = choice[0]
    number = choice[1]
    row = int(number) - 1
    column = translate[letter]
    return (row, column)
